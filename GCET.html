		<h1>One funny thing about college life is that teachers make you sleep during day and friends donâ€™t let you to sleep at night (and sometimes the deadlines too)</h1><br><br>
<h3>If cricket is the national obsession of India as far as sports is concerned, then ensuring that their child takes up engineering is definitely the obsession of every Indian parent. Our country produces 15 lakh engineering graduates every year and here are a few things that probably every engineer (or engineer to be) will relate to:</h3><br>
1.	The endless lectures that seem to stretch on forever. These are supposed to arm you with engineering superpowers, but nothing much seems to seep into your brains<br><br>
2.	No matter how well you plan your semester to get a decent GPA score, you have to deal with many bouncers (surprise tests, endless assignments, group projects)<br>
<br>3.	No one has perfected the art of last-minute studying like the engineers have. In fact, they're so confident of their capabilities that partying in the week before exams is the norm. But the night before the exam sees us finishing a 400 page book in 4 hours!<br><br>
4.	No one shares our sense of humour except fellow engineering students. In fact, we get a strange kick from cracking those nerdy jokes that no else but we understand.<br><br>
5.	There are two types of engineering students. Those who wake up at 4 in the morning and those who go to sleep at 4 in the morning. It is another matter, that the hours spent waking up are not always utilized for studying!<br><br>
6.	When the day of viva dawns and everyone is equally clueless. The first one to come out after the viva Q&A session gets hounded by the rest and how!<br><br>
7.	Your senior (to be called "sir/ma'am") is always right and imparts you the real knowledge that you need to know. <br><br>
8.	Every fresher at an engineering college knows that and respects their seniors accordingly. Things you learn from your seniors include the fact that just GPAs don't matter - extra-curricular activities are equally important for landing a good job placement.<br><br>
9.	No matter how excruciatingly tough those 4 (or 5 or 6) years of engineering seem, truth is that you'll miss this time for the rest of your life!<br><br>
10.	And at the end of it all, you'll walk out of college having learnt a lot more than just engineering.<br></div>
