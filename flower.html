		<h3>SOLITUDE IN THE WILD</h3>
Forlorn as a destitute child,<br>
I wandered to the distant wild;<br>
Through a peculiar lonelier wood,<br>
Like a wave, roving as fast as I could.<br>
Not long, I came by a myrtle river bank<br>
Where early boughs grow wild and rank.<br>
<br>
There my eyes kissed upon wild flowers,<br>
All grandly dressed in neon colours,<br>
Rhythmically whispering lullabies,<br>
Ineffably upon velvety indigo skies,<br>
Whilst swaying in a friskier dance,<br>
That could render naked eyes in a trance.<br>
<br>
At such a mesmerizing sight,<br>
I drowned in a pool of sweet delight<br>
Hence in wonderment shook my head,<br>
And in a velvety voice whispered:<br>
"Flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers<br>
What brings about thy Ineffable colors?"<br>
<br>
And all flowers smiled and smiled,<br>
And exuberantly all thus replied:<br>
<br>
"At dusk, when fair maidens of the night<br>
Grandly dress in flocks, of burning bright;<br>
And madly smiles about skies above,<br>
Oh! Their opalscent eyes we flowers love:<br>
So, from their pulchritudenous color;<br>
So lies the mysteries of our allure."<br>
<br>
At such a mesmerizing reply,<br>
Sweet delight oozed from mine eye<br>
Hence in wonderment shook my head,<br>
And in a velvety voice whispered:<br>
"Flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers<br>
What brings about thy ineffable colors?"<br>
<br>
And all flowers smiled and smiled,<br>
And exuberantly all thus replied:<br>
<br>
"At dawn, when the day's watchman<br>
Doth weareth his novelty crown,<br>
And treads upon yonder skies above,<br>
Oh! His golden crown we flowers love:<br>
So, from his pulchritudenous color;<br>
So lies the mysteries of our allure."<br>
<br>
At such a mesmerizing reply,<br>
Sweet delight oozed from mine eye<br>
Hence in wonderment shook my head,<br>
And in a velvety voice whispered:<br>
"Flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers<br>
What brings about thy ineffable colors?"<br>
<br>
And all flowers smiled and smiled,<br>
And exuberantly all thus replied:<br>
<br>
"When envious veils of dusk engulfs day,<br>
Paving the fairest Empress way;<br>
To grandly grace on yonder skies above,<br>
Oh! Her rainbow robes we flowers love:<br>
So, from her pulchritudenous colour;<br>
So lies the mysteries of our allure."<br>
<br>
At such a mesmerizing reply,<br>
Sweet delight oozed from mine eye<br>
Hence in wonderment shook my head,<br>
And in a velvety voice whispered:<br>
"Flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers<br>
What brings about thy ineffable colors?"<br>
<br>
'And all,' all flowers smiled and smiled;<br>
I mean, smiled, smiled and smiled,<br>
I say, smiled, smiled and smiled,<br>
And happiness bloomed in the wild.<br> Written by
