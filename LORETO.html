		<h3>God made all girls equal but then some of them went to loreto!!</h3>
		<h4>You know you're a loretoite when you do more cleaning than the supoort staf.<br>
		~When loreto chorus runs in your blooooodd~<br></h4>
		You know you're a loretoite when annual fete is the EVENT OF THE Year and you start working for it way more than a month in advance.<br><br>
		You know you're a loretoite when you're more scared by the co-ordinator than the Principal.<br><br>
		When water-cooler is your third home!<br><br>
		"Came back from school without praying"....said no convent student ever!<br><br>
		You're a true loretoite when you're allergic to grammatical mistakes...ughhh
		<br><br>
		And those PT Display practices that started 2-3 months in advance!(I started feeling tired even after thinking about that tiring affair.)<br><br>
		Nevertheless, Loreto Convent will always be my second home for it has given me the most wonderful memories and best people I could have asked for. It will forever stay in my heart. And to all those who're still studing there,I want to tell you that you guys are really blessed and you should cherish each and every moment of your student life.
